Built and tested various container types including Stacks/Queues, Hash Functions, Binary Search Trees, and AVL Trees.
Additionally, built/tested Sorting Algorithms and Dijkstra's and Kruskal's Searching Algorithms.


All container types adhere to these basic contraints:
functions: 
  1. insert: inserts into container
  2. remove: removes from container
  3. find (not in Stacks/Queues): depending on implementation, either returns reference, index, or boolean value

Testing:
All containers were emperically tested and analyzed to determine time complexity and memory usage.

All code is in designated branches for each container/algorithm.
